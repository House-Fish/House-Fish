# Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹  

I'm Jia Yu, a cybersecurity student with a curious mind for all things tech. From mobile and web development to programming microcontrollers, I love exploring diverse technologies and building creative projects.  

This GitHub is a space for my experiments and quirky ideas â€” feel free to stick around and see what I come up with next! ðŸ˜Š
